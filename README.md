## Motivation 
<a name="motivation"></a>
The coronavirus pandemic launched the idea that small main street shop owners needed a means to keep in contact with their customers. On the flip side customers at home in self-isolation with limited mobility might want to communicate with shop owners, just like if they were strolling down main street. Even after the pandemic subsides YellowChat will fill a void. Elderly and people who need assistance will use it. Also, the "stay at home" society that seems to be thriving will love YellowChat.


## Features
<a name="features"></a>
* Simple, easy to use, intuitive UI. 
* Vendors and customers seperately log in. 
* Vendors see all customers available to chat and customers see all vendors avaliable to chat. 
* A Review blog where customers can blog about vendors or just about anything.

## Future
<a name="future "></a>
Currently capturing activity on main pages. We will use this to create a dashboard to record all a user activity on the site, chats, reviews, etc. To help monetize the vendors will get a certain number of their products listed for free. If they wish for more and have more exposure they can for a modest fee. 
Plan to add a credit card and advertising platform. Create a social network where YellowChat users can comunicate with other.
